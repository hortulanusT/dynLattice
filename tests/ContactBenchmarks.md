# Contact Benchmarks {#contact_benchmarks}
## Overview
The contact tests validate the contact formulation and implementation of the current framework.

## Test Cases
### Test 1
Test 1 implements Example 2 from [Zavarise, Wriggers (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-0207(20001120)49:8%3C977::AID-NME986%3E3.0.CO;2-C) without friction. In this example, a cantilever beam is pushed against a beam fixed on both ends and the resulting contact forces are recorded. The custom implementation shows good agreement with the results from literature.
