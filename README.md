\mainpage dynLattice

Welcome to the `dynLattice` documentation. This project contains JIVE code to simulate lattices undergoing high strain-rate dynamic deformation based on nonlinear beam elements. It also contains some test files to verify the correctness of the implementation.

# Requirements
- **[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)**
- [JEM/JIVE 3.0](https://dynaflow.com/software/jive/jive-downloads/)
- [OpenMPI 4.1.1](https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v4.1/openmpi-4.1.1.tar.gz)
- [GMSH 4.9.5](https://gmsh.info/bin/Linux/gmsh-4.9.5-Linux64-sdk.tgz)
- [HDF5 1.12.2](https://support.hdfgroup.org/archive/support/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.12/hdf5-1.12.2/src/hdf5-1.12.2.tar.gz)

To build the container put all the required archives into a folder called `zip` and run the command `sudo apptainer build jive.sif jive.def`.
You can subsequently move the `jive.sif` to any location you prefer.

To create an alias for easier executing use `alias jive="apptainer -s exec -e --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY </full/path/to/>jive.sif"`.
The test-cases can subsequently be run using `jive make tests`.
