# Rod-based Lattice Simulations
This repository contains JEM/JIVE code to simulate lattices undergoing high strain-rate dynamic deformation based on nonlinear beam elements. It also contains some test files to verify the correctness of the implementation.

The documentation for JEM/JIVE, on which most of the classes used in this project are based, can be found [here](https://jive-manual.dynaflow.com/index.html).

**📋 [Benchmarks](tests/Benchmarks.md)** - List of all the numerical benchmarks implemented as test cases for this repository. These are provided as an example for how to use the code.

## Requirements
- **Apptainer**
  - [JEM/JIVE 3.0](https://dynaflow.com/software/jive/jive-downloads/)
  - [OpenMPI 4.1.1](https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v4.1/openmpi-4.1.1.tar.gz)
  - [GMSH 4.9.5](https://gmsh.info/bin/Linux/gmsh-4.9.5-Linux64-sdk.tgz)
  - [HDF5 1.12.2](https://support.hdfgroup.org/archive/support/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.12/hdf5-1.12.2/src/hdf5-1.12.2.tar.gz)

To build the container put all the required archives into a folder called `zip` and run the command `sudo apptainer build jive.sif jive.def`.
You can subsequently move the `jive.sif` to any location you prefer.

To create an alias for easier executing use `alias jive="apptainer -s exec -e </full/path/to/>jive.sif"`.
The test-cases can subsequently be run using `jive make tests`.
